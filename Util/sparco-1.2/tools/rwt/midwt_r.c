Change History: Fixed the code such that 1D vectors passed to it can be in
                either passed as a row or column vector. Also took care of 
		the code such that it will compile with both under standard
		C compilers as well as for ANSI C compilers

		Fix minor bug to allow maximum number of levels

decription of the matlab call:
%y = midwt(x,h,L);
% 
% function computes the inverse discrete wavelet transform y for a 1D or 2D
% input signal x.
%
%    Input:
%	x    : finite length 1D or 2D input signal (implicitely periodized)
%       h    : scaling filter
%       L    : number of levels. in case of a 1D signal length(x) must be
%              divisible by 2^L; in case of a 2D signal the row and the
%              column dimension must be divisible by 2^L.
