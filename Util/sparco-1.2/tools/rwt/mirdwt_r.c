Change History: Fixed the code such that 1D vectors passed to it can be in
                either passed as a row or column vector. Also took care of 
		the code such that it will compile with both under standard
		C compilers as well as for ANSI C compilers

                Fix minor bug to allow maximum number of levels

MATLAB description:
%function x = mirdwt(yl,yh,h,L);
% 
% function computes the inverse redundant discrete wavelet transform y for a
% 1D or  2D input signal. redundant means here that the subsampling after
% each stage of the forward transform has been omitted. yl contains the
% lowpass and yl the highpass components as computed, e.g., by mrdwt. In
% case of a 2D signal the ordering in yh is [lh hl hh lh hl ... ] (first
% letter refers to row, second to column filtering).  
%
%    Input:
%       yl   : lowpass component
%       yh   : highpass components
%       h    : scaling filter
%       L    : number of levels. in case of a 1D signal length(yl) must be
%              divisible by 2^L; in case of a 2D signal the row and the
%              column dimension must be divisible by 2^L.
%   
%    Output:
%	x    : finite length 1D or 2D signal
%
