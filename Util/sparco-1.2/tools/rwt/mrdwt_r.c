Change History: Fixed the code such that 1D vectors passed to it can be in
                either passed as a row or column vector. Also took care of 
		the code such that it will compile with both under standard
		C compilers as well as for ANSI C compilers

MATLAB description:
%[yl,yh] = mrdwt(x,h,L);
% 
% function computes the redundant discrete wavelet transform y for a 1D or
% 2D input signal . redundant means here that the subsampling after each
% stage is omitted. yl contains the lowpass and yl the highpass
% components. In case of a 2D signal the ordering in yh is [lh hl hh lh hl
% ... ] (first letter refers to row, second to column filtering). 
%
%    Input:
%	x    : finite length 1D or 2D signal (implicitely periodized)
%       h    : scaling filter
%       L    : number of levels. in case of a 1D signal length(x) must be
%              divisible by 2^L; in case of a 2D signal the row and the
%              column dimension must be divisible by 2^L.
%   
%    Output:
%       yl   : lowpass component
%       yh   : highpass components
